		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Portfolio holdings may cover a variety of investment products, including stocks, bonds and mutual funds to options, futures and exchange-traded funds, and relatively esoteric instruments such as private equity and hedge funds. 

The number and nature of holdings contribute to the degree of diversification of a portfolio. A mix of stocks across different sectors, bonds of different maturities, and other investments would suggest a well-diversified portfolio, while concentrated holdings in a handful of stocks within a single sector indicates a portfolio with limited diversification.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
