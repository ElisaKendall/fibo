		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">structured product that participates in the performance of a financial asset, such as a stock, fund or index, while protecting the investor&apos;s capital</skos:definition>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Depending on the product, they may participate to varying degrees in the underlying asset&apos;s upside and protect the capital either entirely or partially.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&fibo-der-drc-str;StructuredProduct"/>
		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">leveraged product</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">structured product that provides a further enhanced yield (over and above that of a yield-enhancement product), often without any limit to the upside participation, and frequently with a stop-loss in order to limit potential capital losses</skos:definition>
		<skos:example xml:lang="en">Leveraged certificates are examples of leveraged products; they provide enhanced participation to an underlying with inbuilt leverage. Leveraged exposure is also provided on the downside performance of the underlying. Another example is a call warrant, which is simply a call option that is traded in a securitized format. This format is interesting in order to be able to trade a call option on underlyings for which no exchange traded option market exists.</skos:example>

		<rdfs:label xml:lang="en">participation certificate</rdfs:label>
		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">participation product that provides the possibility to participate in the gains or losses in the price of an asset, subject to counterparty risk</skos:definition>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">In many cases, certificates do not give the investor the right to receive dividend distributions from the underlying stocks or other assets. For example: You buy a bonus certificate issued by your bank which is based on a stock that pays annual dividends. During the certificate&apos;s term, the bank holds the underlying stock and receives the dividends. At the end of the term, the bank pays the predefined bonus, even though the actual price of the stock is lower (but not below the protection threshold).Depending on the type of certificate, the exact terms and conditions, and the contract&apos;s expiry date, it is possible that the investor may receive the underlying asset instead of money at the end of the investment term. That is often the case with discount certificates based on stocks, for example, when their price sits below the predetermined cap. If the certificate&apos;s issuer becomes insolvent, the assets which underly the certificate are considered part of the issuer&apos;s liquid assets. This is in contrast to owning actual securities or shares in investment funds, as these are segregated assets which remain the property of the investor if the broker or custodian bank fails.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">A structured product is a pre-packaged structured finance investment strategy based on a single security, a basket of securities, options, indices, commodities, debt issuance or foreign currencies, and to a lesser extent, derivatives. Structured products are not homogeneous - there are numerous varieties of derivatives and underlying assets - but they can be classified under the aside categories. Typically, a desk will employ a specialized &apos;structurer&apos; to design and manage its structured-product offering.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

They provide a predetermined yield per annum in return for the willingness of the investor to absorb downside risk of for example a stock, index, currency-pair or fund. Reverse convertibles come in a broad range of variations (with or without barrier, multiple underlyings and/or callability).</skos:example>
