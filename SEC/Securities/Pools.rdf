		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">A fund is an entity created to pool money from multiple investors - often referred to as limited partners. Each investor makes an investment in the fund by purchasing an interest in the fund entity, and the adviser uses that money to make investments on behalf of the fund.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">Collective investment vehicles are typically organized and operated by management companies, banks, or trust companies. Shares or units are issued in the form of unit trusts, mutual funds, or other similar contracts. Common kinds of funds include pension funds, insurance funds, foundations, and endowments. Such pools are often invested and professionally managed, including investment pools, umbrella pools, share class pools, etc.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<skos:definition>component of a pool</skos:definition>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>A pool may consist of almost anything brought together for some purpose. It differs from a less formal collection in that there are typically facts defined about the members of the pool and potentially regarding the proportions of those members in the pool. Pool membership may change over time, and certain facts about the pool may also vary over time. However, the basic nature of something as a member of the pool is static while that membership holds.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
