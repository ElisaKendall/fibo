Because there are significant differences in market practices between the derivatives markets and the international foreign exchange spot and forward markets, parties to the ISDA frequently incorporate the ISDA FX and Currency Options Definitions and further tailor the ISDA Schedule to reflect standard market practice for the foreign exchange products.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
