		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20180801/RateDerivatives/RateDerivatives.rdf version of this ontology was extended to include foreign exchange rates, forward rate agreements, and revise definitions to be unambiguous and ISO 704 compliant.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20201201/RateDerivatives/RateDerivatives.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate the dependency on NonPhysicalUnderlier, which was redundant.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20210801/RateDerivatives/RateDerivatives.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary, to move the definition of an underlier and the related property, has underlier, to financial instruments so that these concepts are also available for use in relation to pool-backed securities.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20230201/RateDerivatives/RateDerivatives.rdf version of this ontology was modified to replace content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20240101/RateDerivatives/RateDerivatives.rdf version of this ontology was modified to deprecate ForeignExchangeRateObservable after other changes that eliminated its usage in currency derivatives and made it obsolete (DER-143).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20240901/RateDerivatives/RateDerivatives.rdf version of this ontology was modified to simplify and refine definitions related to underliers (DER-112).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DER/20250301/RateDerivatives/RateDerivatives.rdf version of this ontology was modified to further simplify and clarify definitions (DER-90). Note that under DER-90, the remaining terms that were in this ontology have moved to Derivatives Basics, and this ontology will be eliminated when the deprecated elements are eliminated (at least 6 months from 4/2025).</skos:changeNote>
