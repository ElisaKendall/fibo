		<skos:definition xml:lang="en">role of a financial institution (often one of the primary lenders in the syndicate) designated to act as an intermediary between the borrowers and the syndicate lenders</skos:definition>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">An administrative agent is designated by the syndicate and granted the authority to disburse funds, collect payments, monitor compliance and act as the communications intermediary with the borrower on behalf of the syndicate. This coordination role is crucial to ensuring that lenders&apos; rights and oblications are properly coordinated and to streamline operations. Their authority and the scope of what they can do is explicitly stated in the loan agreement, and does not allow unilateral decision making with respect to the terms of the loan.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">A &apos;bookrunner&apos; is primarily responsible for managing the distribution and sale of a security during a new issuance, while a &apos;lead arranger&apos; is the primary bank that structures and leads a syndicated loan, often assigning portions of the loan to other banks to participate in the deal; essentially, the bookrunner focuses on selling the security to investors, while the lead arranger focuses on structuring the loan itself and coordinating the syndicate of lenders involved.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote xml:lang="en">A syndicated loan enables pooling of funds from multiple financial institutions, typically under the leadership of one or more arranging banks.
